# ✋ Hand Gesture to Voice Communication System

An AI-powered real-time **Hand Gesture to Voice Communication System** designed to assist individuals with speech or hearing impairments. This system leverages **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **MediaPipe** to recognize predefined hand gestures and convert them into audible speech using **pyttsx3**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To create an inclusive assistive technology that bridges the communication gap for the specially-abled by translating hand gestures into spoken voice.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- **MediaPipe**
- **pyttsx3** (Text-to-Speech)
- **Webcam / Camera Input**

---

## 🌟 Features

- ✅ Real-time hand gesture detection using computer vision  
- ✅ Voice output for each recognized gesture  
- ✅ Predefined gestures like:
  - *"I love you"* ❤️  
  - *"Help"* 🆘  
  - *"Thank you"* 🙏  
  - *"Miss you"* 🥺  
- ✅ Lightweight, offline, and fast performance  
- ✅ Designed for accessible and inclusive communication

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. The webcam captures real-time video input.
2. MediaPipe detects the hand landmarks.
3. A custom gesture is matched from predefined gestures.
4. On match, the corresponding phrase is spoken aloud using pyttsx3.
